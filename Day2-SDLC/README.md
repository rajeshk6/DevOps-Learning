# SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

## Overview  
The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process followed in the software industry to design, develop,
and test high-quality software. It ensures that software meets business requirements while being efficient and maintainable.

## SDLC Phases  
The SDLC consists of six main phases:

1. **Planning** – Gathering requirements and defining project scope.  
2. **Defining** – Creating software requirement specifications (SRS) to establish clear objectives.  
3. **Designing** – Developing high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD) to outline architecture and system flow.  
4. **Building** – Actual coding and software development.  
5. **Testing** – Verifying and validating the software to ensure quality and functionality.  
6. **Deployment** – Releasing the software into production and monitoring for issues.  

## Role of a DevOps Engineer  
A **DevOps Engineer** plays a crucial role in automating various phases of the SDLC, especially in **deployment and testing**,to ensure seamless software delivery.
