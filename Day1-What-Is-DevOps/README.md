#Why Devops


Before the adoption of DevOps, the process of deploying applications to production was complex and time-consuming. The traditional deployment process involved multiple teams and manual steps, which often led to delays and inefficiencies.

Traditional Deployment Process:
Development Phase:

Developers write the application code and build the software.

System Administration:

The system administrators create the necessary servers.

Deployment:

After setting up the server, a Build and Release Engineer (BRE) is responsible for deploying the application on the server.

Application Server Setup:

The system administrator configures the application server, which hosts the deployed application.

Challenges of Traditional Deployment:
Time-Consuming: The entire process could take several days.

Manual Process: Many steps required manual intervention, increasing the chances of errors.

Lack of Collaboration: Developers, system administrators, and release engineers worked in silos, leading to communication gaps and inefficiencies.
